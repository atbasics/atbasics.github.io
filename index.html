            <h2>What is assistive technology?</h2>
            <h2>History of assistive technology</h2>
            <h2>Types of assistive technology</h2>
            <p>There are three types of assistive technologies low tech, mid tech, and high tech. 
<br> - Low 
<br> - Mid
<br> - High 
</p>
            <h2>Examples of how we use it every day</h2>
            <p>We may not realize it, but we use assistive technology in our 
                everyday lives! The Alexa that assists you in your everyday life, 
                making life a little easier, is a perfect example of assistive 
                technology. Maybe the glasses you use to help you see or read, </p>
            <h2>Who uses it?</h2>
            <p>Anyone can use assistive technology. Whether an individual has a 
                disability, chronic illness, is elderly or not, is blind, has low 
                vision, is hard of hearing, or does not relate to any of these, 
                assistive technology is part of our everyday lives. We may not 
                realize it, but we use assistive technology in our everyday lives! 
                The Alexa sitting on your table at home, the glasses you wear to 
                see, a pencil grip holder, a white cane, and a wheelchair. These 
                are just a few examples of assistive technology that individuals 
                use but may not realize. </p>
