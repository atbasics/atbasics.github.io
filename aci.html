            <h1>Aging</h1>
            <h2>The aging and elderly Population</h2>
            <p>According to the National Council on Aging, 57.8 million adults aged 
                65 and older were living in the U.S. as of 2022. This number is 
                projected to increase to 78.3 million by 2040. As people age, chronic 
                health issues such as heart disease, arthritis, or diabetes become more 
                common. Many older adults may also experience feelings of loss of 
                independence or of becoming a burden to loved ones as they face challenges 
                with daily activities. Assistive technology plays a crucial role in 
                helping seniors maintain their independence, dignity, and quality of life.</p>
            <h2>What Happens When You Age?</h2>
            <p>As people age, they may experience changes such as vision loss, hearing loss, 
                memory challenges, or physical difficulties. It is essential to recognize 
                that aging itself is not a disability. A disability is defined as any condition 
                of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for a person to 
                do certain activities. That is not to say that older adults may need to use 
                assistive technologies such as hearing aids, walking canes, or walkers.</p>
            <h2>Common Age-Related Disabilities</h2>
            <p>Loss of vision, Age-related macular degeneration, Cataracts and glaucoma, Hearing loss, Dementia, Alzheimers, and Stroke</p>
            <h2>How Can Assistive Technology Help the Aging and Elderly Population?</h2>
            <p>Assistive technology (AT) can support older adults by increasing safety, independence, and comfort in daily life. These tools make everyday tasks easier and help seniors stay active, connected, and confident.
                Some examples of assistive technology that the aging and elderly population may use include:
            <br>&emsp;- Safety at Home
            <br>&emsp;- Fall-detection devices
            <br>&emsp;- Emergency alert buttons
            <br>&emsp;- Smart home sensors and cameras
            <br>&emsp;- Automatic lights and night-light</p>

        <h1>Chronic Illness</h1>
        <h2>What Is Chronic Illness, and How Many People Have It?</h2>
        <p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic illness is defined as “conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention, limit activities of daily living, or both.” While chronic illnesses often do not have a cure, they can be managed through ongoing treatment and support.
        According to the World Health Organization, over 2.5 billion people worldwide need one or more assistive products, such as hearing aids, wheelchairs, or communication apps. In the United States, more than 90% of adults aged 65 and older have at least one chronic condition.
        More than 75% of U.S. adults ages 35–64 have at least one chronic illness, and 60% of adults ages 18–34 also report living with a chronic condition.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the different health conditions?</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of just a few health conditions:
        <br>&emsp;- Diabetes
        <br>&emsp;- Epilepsy
        <br>&emsp;- Sickle Cell disease
        <br>&emsp;- Cancer

        <br>&emsp;- Alzheimer’s disease
        <br>&emsp;- Endometriosis
        </p>
        <h2>How Does Chronic Illness Affect People?</h2>
        <p>Chronic illness may affect a person's day-to-day life physically, emotionally, and financially. Chronic illness can affect the body by causing fatigue, pain, mobility challenges, changes in organ function, brain fog, and increased stress. It can make daily tasks harder and require ongoing care.
        </p>
        <h2>How Can Assistive Technology Help with Chronic Illness?</h2>
        <p>Assistive technology can make daily life easier, safer, and more manageable for people living with chronic illnesses. It supports independence, reduces physical strain, and helps individuals monitor their health. People may use different types of assistive technology based on their unique needs, and not everyone will use the same tools in the same way.
        Here are some ways assistive technology may help people manage chronic illness:
        </p>
