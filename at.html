            <h1>Assistive Technology</h1>
            <h2>What is assistive technology?</h2>
            <p>Assistive technology refers to tools, devices, or systems that support 
                individuals in performing functions that might otherwise be difficult 
                or impossible. These technologies enhance independence, improve quality 
                of life, and promote inclusion for people of all ages and abilities.</p>
            
            <h2>History of assistive technology</h2>
            <p>Assistive Technology has been a part of our society since the earliest 
                known civilizations. One example of assistive technology was the walking 
                cane, which the Ancient Egyptians used not only as a tool but also as a 
                form of status and authority. The walking cane was also used to assist 
                individuals with difficulty walking. Another example is a prosthetic limb 
                from ancient Egypt, estimated to be 2,600-3,400 years old. In 1824, Louis 
                Braille, who had lost his sight as a child, created a system that enabled 
                blind and visually impaired individuals to read and write independently. 
                We now know this system as Braille. Assistive technology has been around 
                for quite some time; we have simply not paid sufficient attention to it.</p>
            <h2>Who Uses Assistive Technology</h2>
            <p>Assistive technology is used by a wide range of people—including those with 
                disabilities, chronic illnesses, seniors, and even those without specific 
                conditions.</p>
            <h2>Examples of How We Use Assistive Technology Every Day</h2>
            <p>Below are some common ways assistive technology is part of our daily routines:
                <br>&emsp;- Captions on videos
                <br>&emsp;- Voice-to-text for messages
                <br>&emsp;- Smart home devices (e.g., Alexa, security cameras, smart watches, smart TVs)
                <br>&emsp;- Screen readers and magnifiers
                <br>&emsp;- Reminders and alarms
                <br>&emsp;- Ramps and automatic doors
                <br>&emsp;- Accessibility settings on phones</p>
            <h2>How Many People Use Assistive Technology?</h2>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 2.5 billion people 
                worldwide use at least one assistive technology product. It is estimated that 
                by 2050, the number of individuals using assistive technology will reach 3.5 
                billion, driven by an aging population and the prevalence of noncommunicable 
                diseases (long-term health conditions that develop over time and are not contagious; 
                examples include diabetes, cancer, and heart disease).</p>
            <h2>Types of Assistive Technology</h2>
            <p>Assistive technologies are commonly categorized as low-tech, mid-tech, or high-tech, 
                based on their complexity and functionality.
                <br>Low-tech: Simple, non-electronic tools such as pencil grips, magnifying glasses, or canes.
                <br>Mid-tech: Devices that require some power or electronics but are not highly complex, such as audio recorders, talking calculators, or amplified telephones.
                <br>High-tech: Advanced electronic or computerized systems, including screen readers, speech-to-text software, and smart home assistants like Alexa.
