            <h1>Visual</h1>
            <p>Visual impairments refer to conditions that affect a person’s ability to see, ranging from mild vision loss to total blindness. These may be present at birth or acquired over time due to aging, injury, or disease.
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people have near or distance vision impairment, and half of these cases could have been prevented or are yet to be addressed.
            </p>
            <h2>Blind/Low Vision</h2>
            <p>Visual impairment is a term that describes any degree of vision loss that cannot be fully corrected with glasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery. It includes moderate and severe visual impairment, as well as total blindness.​
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Visual Impairment</h2>
            <p>Uncorrected vision: Vision loss that has not been addressed with corrective lenses or treatment.
            <br>Moderate visual impairment: Reduced vision that makes daily tasks challenging, even with corrective lenses.
            <br>Severe visual impairment: Significantly limited vision that impacts most activities, even with correction.
            <br>Blindness: Very limited or no vision; may include light perception only or no visual perception at all.
            </p>
