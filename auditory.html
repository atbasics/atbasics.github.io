            <h1>Auditory</h1>
            <p>Auditory impairments, or hearing loss, affect a person’s ability to hear sounds, ranging from mild to profound, and may affect one or both ears. Causes may include genetics, aging, illness, or exposure to loud noise.
            According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, 1 in 8 people in the U.S. (30 million) ages 12 or older has hearing loss in both ears.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Hearing Loss and Common Causes</h2>
            <p>Conductive: Caused by blockages or damage in the outer or middle ear that prevent sound from reaching the inner ear. Examples include built-up earwax, fluid in the middle ear, infections, or a ruptured eardrum.
            <br>&emsp;- built up earwax
            <br>&emsp;- fluid in the middle ear due to colds or allergies
            <br>&emsp;- middle ear infection
            <br>&emsp;- swimmers ear
            <br>&emsp;- ear tumors
            <br>&emsp;- ruptured eardrum
            <br>Sensorineural: Results from damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve. This type often occurs gradually due to aging, illness, or long-term exposure to loud noise, but it can also happen suddenly.
            <br>&emsp;- aging
            <br>&emsp;- illnesses such as heart disease, high blood pressure, strokes, and diabetes
            <br>&emsp;- long-term exposure to loud, noisy environments like factories or construction sites
            <br>Mixed: Involves both conductive and sensorineural components, meaning there are problems in both the outer or middle ear and the inner ear or auditory nerve.
            <br>Hard of Hearing: Refers to people with mild to severe hearing loss who usually use spoken language and may benefit from hearing aids or other assistive technology.
            <br>&emsp;- Use spoken language
            <br>&emsp;- May use hearing aids, cochlear implants, or other assistive technology
            <br>Deaf: Describes people with profound hearing loss who cannot understand speech through hearing alone. They may use sign language, lip-reading, or written communication.
            <br>&emsp;- May benefit from cochlear implants
            <br>&emsp;- May use sign language as a form of communication
            <br>Deaf (with a capital “D”): Refers to people who identify as part of the Deaf community, which has a distinct culture and uses sign language as a primary means of communication. Understanding Deaf culture is important for inclusivity and respect.
            <br>Congenital Hearing Loss: Hearing loss present at birth, which may be due to genetics, infections during pregnancy, or complications at birth.
            <br>Genetic or Hereditary Hearing Loss: Caused by genetic factors that affect the development or function of the hearing system.

            <h2>Tips for Communicating with People Who Have Hearing Loss or Are Deaf</h2>
            <p>Always include the person with hearing loss in a conversation
            <br>&emsp;- Finding a quiet place to have a conversation will help reduce background noise, so the individual will have less difficulty participating in the conversation
            <br>&emsp;- Make sure the place where you're conversing has good lighting for the use of facial expressions
            <br>&emsp;- always face the person and speak clearly, try maintaining eye contact
            <br>&emsp;- Avoid hiding your mouth, eating, or chewing gum while talking
            <br>&emsp;- Have one person talk at a time
            <br>&emsp;- Try learning sign language if the person is deaf​

            <h2>Assistive Technology for Hearing Loss</h2>
            <p>Various devices and systems can help people with hearing loss or deafness communicate, access information, and stay safe. Below are some common types:
            <br>Assistive listening devices: Amplify sound and reduce background noise. Commonly used in classrooms, theaters, and public spaces.
            <br>&emsp;- Audio induction (hearing loop): Transmits sound directly to hearing aids or cochlear implants equipped with telecoils, improving clarity in public spaces.
            <br>&emsp;- FM system: A Wireless system that sends a speaker’s voice directly to a listener’s hearing aid or receiver. Often used in schools or group settings.
            <br>&emsp;- Infrared system: Uses infrared light to transmit sound to personal receivers. Commonly used in theaters or conference rooms.
            <br>&emsp;- Personal amplified system: A Portable device that amplifies sound for one-on-one conversations or small group settings.
            <br>&emsp;- Bluetooth system: Allows wireless audio streaming from phones, TVs, or other devices directly to hearing aids or cochlear implants.
            <br>Assistive listening systems: Deliver sound from a public address system directly to a receiver in a hearing aid, cochlear implant, or external device, improving clarity and reducing background noise.
            <br>&emsp;- Hearing loop systems: Same as audio induction loops, commonly installed in public venues for accessibility.
            <br>&emsp;- Auracast broadcast audio: Next-generation Bluetooth technology that allows multiple users to receive high-quality audio from public address systems through their own devices.
            <br>&emsp;- (Omit, as this is a repeat of 'infrared system' above.)
            <br>&emsp;- (Omit, as this is a repeat of 'FM system' above.)
            <br>&emsp;- Wi-Fi audio systems: Transmit sound wirelessly, allowing users to connect via personal devices or hearing aids.
            <br>Alerting devices: Use visual cues (lights), vibrations, or loud sounds to notify users of important events, such as doorbells, alarms, or phone calls. These devices increase safety and awareness at home or in public.
            <br>&emsp;- (Omit, as this is included above in 'alerting devices'.)
            <br>&emsp;- Bed and pillow shakers: Vibrating devices placed under a mattress or pillow to wake users or alert them to alarms.
